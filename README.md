# Surfs up
## Overview
Using pandas in python to retrieve data on temperature trends before opening a surf shop from a SQL database using SQLAlchemy.<br />
## Results
- Theres a total of 1700 counts of temperature recordings for June, and only 1517 recordings for December. <br />
- The mean temperature for the two months are 74.9 and 71 degrees for June and December, respectively. <br />
- The difference in temperature isn't too much between the summer month of June and winter months of December with the maximum, minimum, and the 3 quartiles with in similar range. <br />
- The IQR for June is 4 degrees, and 5 degrees for december, and similar standard deviation of 3.25 and 3.75, respectively.<br />
- This is expected as the surf shop is located in hawaii, which is near the equator with year-round summer season.<br />

## Summary
The analysis helped the owners W. Avy to identify the patterns in weather and climate, and also opens doors to predict sales through out the year.<br />
To further this analysis, we can also look at the precipitation data in the dataset. The amount of rain can also have an impact on sales revenue and operations of the firm. <br />
