# Surfs up
## Overview
Using pandas in python to retrieve data on temperature trends before opening a surf shop from a SQL database using SQLAlchemy.<br />
## Results
- Theres a total of 1700 counts of temperature recordings for June, and only 1517 recordings for December. <br />
- The mean temperature for the two months are 74.9 and 71 degrees for June and December, respectively. <br />
- The difference in temperature isn't too much between the summer month of June and winter months of December with the maximum, minimum, and the 3 quartiles with in similar range. <br />
- The IQR for June is 4 degrees, and 5 degrees for december, and similar standard deviation of 3.25 and 3.75, respectively.<br />
- This is expected as the surf shop is located in hawaii, which is near the equator with year-round summer season.<br />
## Summary
